# API-Classes-CSC232
I created a project for my Object-Oriented Software Development course that included three major Java API classes (Math, LocalDate, Arrays). 

This is a Java Object-Oriented project that uses these Three Java API classes to conduct certain operations in order to utilize and manipulate data. Using the LocalDate class, for example, the software may notify the user how many days are in the current month, whether the current year is a leap year, and whether the entered date/year has passed when compared to the current date/year.
